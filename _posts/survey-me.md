To make things easier for you, we have enabled our handy domain to serve any published survey:

[**http://su.rvey.me**](http://su.rvey.me/)

If you follow that link and see a "The survey could not be found" message, that is because you're supposed to append your short survey ID at the end. You can get that by using the publish button on the editor:
