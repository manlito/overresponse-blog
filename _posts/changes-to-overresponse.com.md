title: Changes to OverResponse.com
date: 2014-01-26

Hello. We've just updated [OverResponse.com](https://overresponse.com/) front end. Now we are a single page application... We hope memory not to be an issue. 

In addition, we added a progress bar at top to give feedback when a request is going on (well, there are some exceptions we don't track). Progress bar is based on [this work](https://github.com/voronianski/ngprogress-lite).

-------------

In a completely apart history, we changed the default templates. You may take a look here: [http://docs.overresponse.com#templates](http://docs.overresponse.com/#templates)
