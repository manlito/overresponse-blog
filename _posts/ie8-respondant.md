title: Internet Explorer 8 and 9 now supported in RESPONDANT
date: 2014-02-05

As some users noted, Internet Explorer support has been weak. Nevertheless, now we support Internet Explorer 8 and up in the respondant side. For respondant side we refer to the code you embed on your site and su.rvey.me.

Support for those browsers at OverResponse.com is not yet available. We really prefer to focus on features that will be used by the majority of people.
