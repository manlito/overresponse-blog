title: Express Account have more power
date: 2014-04-02

Additional item types have been added to the Express accounts. Yet, we're planning to have a 
more consistent offer. For this reason, some of the new available items may be available only for a short
time... Please let us know your opinion.

In addition, some other item types have been removed from standard accounts, which have
not shown good user acceptance.  


Go Standard Program
-------------------

We're thinking about a program that would allow website managers (with +5000 visits per day)
to get free standard accounts. This will be a short period program, nevertheless, it will
help us to spread the word about our service.

What do you think?

<div id="ORReferralProgram"></div>
<script>
  var ORSettings = {
    surveyId: '533cf5d521df3468a200000a',
    containerId: 'ORReferralProgram',
    minimalSize: true,
  };
  var ORScript = document.createElement('script');
  ORScript.async = true;
  ORScript.src = '//overresponse.com/scripts/respondant/respondant.js';
  document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(ORScript);
</script>
