title: Improved Login Process and Help
date: 2014-03-10

We have improved the login process. When you login, assets that are used for the user section are also loaded. To account for latency, we have added a Logging In message in the top bar, login form and register form. Also the behavior of the progress bar was improved.

On-site help
------------

Help presented on site for new users have been improved. Soon we will be adding some videos.


Other changes
------------

Finally, some other bugs haven been fixed, including some reports related the new font based icons for the respondant, where in some cases, it showed wrong proportions.
