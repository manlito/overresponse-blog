title: Refreshed UI Elements
date: 2014-02-15

This time we have reworked our UI elements. Now, instead of the image based elements for radio and checkboxes, we use a custom font (Thanks to [Fontastic](http://fontastic.me) for making this very easy). Also, we have dropped the use of special HTML entities for the arrows and dropdown arrow (now we're better with the font based icon).

In addition, we also refreshed su.rvey.me. We use a different font, that looks even better. We also changed some other default input elements. Remembers, by default we only override radio, checkboxes and dropdowns. The later becase we need the hability to expand it automatically. The other are not normally styled, but when they're, you can override the custom font used (which right now seems to be the most common approach).
