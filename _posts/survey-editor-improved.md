title: Improved Survey Editor
date: 2014-05-30

We did not want to finish May without any updates, so here we anounce we just improved our survey editor to make it easier to use, and more comfortable.

The first change is the new appearance. Take a look:

We decided to use a cleaner design, but we still preserve some of our colors. 

Regarding the red header bar, we moved it up, but it no longer is red. In addition, the template and survey option were moved to the settings dialog (Delivery Tab). The motivation behind this change is to keep as simple as possible the editor, and also, because this setting can be controlled using the JS API, implementers should feel more confident by supplying manually these parameters.

Finally, we did some usability improvements:

- Now, when working on options of a selection item, pressing Enter creates an item.
- When the item has the default label, text will be selected automatically.
