title: Clear Responses
date: 2014-02-08

As requested by some users, we added the option to reset a survey to a state without responses. This avoids the problem of the user doing heavy internal tests and needing to duplicate the survey to finally launch the survey. For instance, when responses are cleared, statistics are also cleared.

We have added a FAQ item in the support page to document how to do it:

Don't forget you can use the support page to provide suggestions for product development.
